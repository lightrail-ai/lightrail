### Data Science

> The Data Science track uses [Lightrail's JupyterLab extension](https://pypi.org/project/lightrail-jupyterlab/) to facilitate communication between Lightrail and JupyterLab. If you haven't already installed it and want JupyterLab integration, follow these directions:
>
> - In JupyterLab, go to the `Extensions` pane & search for `lightrail-jupyterlab`
> - click `Install`, and refresh the page
> - If `lightrail-jupyterlab` does not show up as an installable extension, please upgrade your JupyterLab installation (`pip install --upgrade jupyterlab`). Lightrail requires JupyterLab >= 4.0.0

**Actions**:

2.  `Edit Current JupyterLab Notebook`: When JupyterLab is running, edit a notebook that is currently open in JupyterLab.
3.  `Edit VSCode Notebook`: Edit a `.ipynb` or `.Rmd` notebook that is open in VSCode.

**Token**:

1.  `/datasci.notebook`: Reference a `.ipynb` or `.Rmd` notebook file path that's stored on your computer for use in arbitrary Actions.

### Recipe

1. Open up a notebook in Jupyter Lab
2. Describe the changes you'd like to make in Lightrail
