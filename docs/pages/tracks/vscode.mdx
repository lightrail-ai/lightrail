## VSCode 

There is 1 default Action and 3 supported Tokens for VSCode. 

 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note: The Lightrail VSCode extension must be installed (instructions are [here](/installation)). 
</Callout>

**Action**:
 1. `Propose Changes`: Describe the changes you would like to make in your VSCode project. 

**Tokens**: 
 1. `/vscode.selection`: Highlighted code
 2. `/vscode.current-file`: The most recent tab / file open 
 3. `/vscode.selected-files`: You can select multiple files using `Ctrl/Cmd` with `click`.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠︎">
  `/vscode.selected-files` does not support selecting directories. To select a directory & all of its contents, use the token `/files.path`.  
</Callout>

### Recipe

To edit your VSCode project: 
1. Select the `Propose Changes` Action in Lightrail
2. Add the relevant files that you would like to edit via Tokens and describe the changes you'd like to make
3. Review the diff of the suggested changes in VSCode - you can accept or reject the changes file by file
