# Installation

Lightrail depends on bridge extensions to interact with other software on your machine. To use the built-in VSCode and Chrome integrations, the VSCode and Chrome extensions must be installed separately.

1. **Download & install the appropriate Lightrail Core package for your operating system:**
   - OS X: [lightrail-core.dmg](https://github.com/lightrail-ai/lightrail/releases/latest/download/lightrail-core.dmg)
   - Ubuntu: [lightrail-core.deb](https://github.com/lightrail-ai/lightrail/releases/latest/download/lightrail-core.deb)
   - Fedora: [lightrail-core.rpm](https://github.com/lightrail-ai/lightrail/releases/latest/download/lightrail-core.rpm)
   - _Note: Lightrail does not currently support Windows_
2. **Install the VSCode Extension:**
   - Install this extension in VSCode: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lightrail.lightrail-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lightrail.lightrail-vscode)
     - To do this, press ⌘/ctrl-p to open the VSCode Quick Open UI, then paste in the following command and hit Enter/Return: `ext install lightrail.lightrail-vscode`
3. **Install the Chrome Extension:**
   - Download this file: [lightrail-chrome.zip](https://github.com/lightrail-ai/lightrail/releases/latest/download/lightrail-chrome.zip)
   - Unzip `lightrail-chrome.zip`. It should contain a folder called `dist`.
   - In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`. There should be a toggle in the upper-right labelled `Developer Mode`. Toggle it so that `Developer Mode` is enabled.
   - Click the `Load unpacked` button, and select the `dist` folder (from step 2).
   - Done! For more details / pictures, see: [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked)
4. **Install the JupyterLab Extension & DataSci Track (Optional)**: Lightrail also has a DataSci Track available, for manipulating data notebooks, but it is not included in the default installation. The DataSci track can work with Jupyter/iPython notebooks as well as RMarkdown notebooks. If you'd like to use this functionality, follow these steps:
   - If you're interested in JupyterLab integration, go to the `Extensions` pane in JupyterLab, search for `lightrail-jupyterlab`, click `Install`, and refresh the page
   - In the Lightrail app, open the Configuration UI by clicking on the gear icon in the prompt input box.
   - In the `Tracks` pane (which will open by default), under 'Available', locate the track titled `datasci` and click the install button next to it.
   - You're all set!

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If Lightrail is not visible in the JupyterLab extension search pane, it's
  likely because our extension doesn't support your version of Jupyterlab. Close
  Jupyter, run `pip install --upgrade jupyterlab` in the terminal, and then
  follow the above instructions.
